how to create a requirements traceability matrix report for a python project?

---
A **Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)** is a document that maps and traces requirements throughout the software development lifecycle. For a Python project, it helps ensure that all requirements are addressed in the design, implementation, testing, and deployment phases. Here's how to create an RTM report:

---

### **1. Understand the Purpose of an RTM**
The RTM ensures:
- All requirements are fulfilled.
- No requirement is overlooked during development.
- Traceability across phases (requirement → code → test case).

---

### **2. Identify the Key Components of the RTM**

An RTM typically contains:
1. **Requirement ID**: Unique identifier for each requirement.
2. **Requirement Description**: Brief summary of the requirement.
3. **Priority**: Importance of the requirement (e.g., High, Medium, Low).
4. **Source**: Where the requirement originated (stakeholders, SRS, use cases).
5. **Design/Module Mapping**: Python modules, classes, or functions implementing the requirement.
6. **Test Cases**: Test case IDs that verify the requirement.
7. **Status**: Current status (e.g., Implemented, In Progress, Pending).
8. **Remarks**: Notes on challenges, changes, or clarifications.

---

### **3. Create the RTM Template**

You can create your RTM in a spreadsheet tool (e.g., Excel, Google Sheets) or use project management tools like Jira, Confluence, or specialized software (e.g., ReqView).

#### **Sample Template**

| **Requirement ID** | **Description**     | **Priority** | **Source**      | **Module/Function**    | **Test Case ID(s)** | **Status**  | **Remarks**        |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | ------------ | --------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------- | ----------- | ------------------ |
| RQ-001             | User login feature  | High         | SRS Section 3.1 | `auth.py/login_user`   | TC-01, TC-02        | Implemented | N/A                |
| RQ-002             | Password encryption | High         | SRS Section 3.2 | `security.py/hash_pwd` | TC-03, TC-04        | In Progress | Library: bcrypt    |
| RQ-003             | Generate reports    | Medium       | Client feedback | `reports.py/gen_pdf`   | TC-05, TC-06        | Pending     | Pending API review |

---

### **4. Populate the RTM**

#### **Step 1**: Extract Requirements  
- Review the **SRS** and identify all requirements. Assign a unique ID to each.

#### **Step 2**: Map to Python Modules  
- Link each requirement to specific Python modules, classes, or functions implementing it.

#### **Step 3**: Map to Test Cases  
- Write or identify test cases corresponding to the requirement using tools like **pytest**, **unittest**, or **Behave** (for BDD). Use unique test case IDs.

#### **Step 4**: Track Status  
- Use statuses like **Not Started**, **In Progress**, **Implemented**, or **Validated** to monitor progress.

---

### **5. Automate Traceability (Optional)**

#### Use Tools:
1. **Jira**: Link requirements to tasks and test cases using plugins (e.g., Xray, Zephyr).
2. **ReqView**: For maintaining detailed RTMs.
3. **Python Code Comments**: Use docstrings to reference requirement IDs, e.g.:
   ```python
   """
   Requirement ID: RQ-001
   Implements user login feature.
   """
   def login_user(username, password):
       # code here
   ```

#### Generate Reports Programmatically:
- Use libraries like **pandas** to parse and generate RTM reports from structured data.
- Example:
   ```python
   import pandas as pd

   data = {
       "Requirement ID": ["RQ-001", "RQ-002"],
       "Description": ["User login feature", "Password encryption"],
       "Priority": ["High", "High"],
       "Module": ["auth.py/login_user", "security.py/hash_pwd"],
       "Test Cases": ["TC-01, TC-02", "TC-03, TC-04"],
       "Status": ["Implemented", "In Progress"],
   }

   df = pd.DataFrame(data)
   df.to_csv("RTM_report.csv", index=False)
   ```

---

### **6. Maintain and Update Regularly**
- Update the RTM whenever:
  - New requirements are added.
  - Code or test cases are modified.
  - Requirements are validated.

---

### **7. Share the RTM**
- Share the RTM with stakeholders during reviews.
- Use visualization tools for better clarity, such as graphs or heatmaps to indicate completion status.
